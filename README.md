# Rector Rules for Craft CMS

This package provides [Rector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector) rules for updating plugins and modules to Craft 4.

First, ensure you are running Craft 3.7.35 or later. (Prior versions of Craft weren’t compatible with Rector.)

```sh
composer update craftcms/cms 
```

Then run the following commands:

```sh
composer require php:^8.0.2
```

```sh
composer config minimum-stability dev
```

```sh
composer config prefer-stable true
```

```sh
composer require craftcms/rector:dev-main --dev
```

```sh
vendor/bin/rector process src --config vendor/craftcms/rector/sets/craft-cms-40.php
```

(Replace `src` with the path to your source directory, if not `src/`.)

You can add `--dry-run` to the `vendor/bin/rector` command if you’d like to see what will happen without actually
making any changes yet.

If you have code that extends Craft Commerce classes, you can run the following command as well:

```sh
vendor/bin/rector process src --config vendor/craftcms/rector/sets/craft-commerce-40.php
```

Once the commands are complete, you’re ready to update `craftcms/cms` to Craft 4.

```sh
composer require craftcms/cms:^4.0.0-alpha.1
```

## Advanced Configuration

If you’d like to include additional Rector rules, or customize which files/directories should be processed,
you’ll need to give your project a `rector.php` file.

Here’s an example which runs the Craft 4 rule set, but skips over a `src/integrations/` folder:

```php
<?php
declare(strict_types = 1);

use craft\rector\SetList as CraftSetList;
use Rector\Core\Configuration\Option;
use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Loader\Configurator\ContainerConfigurator;

return static function(ContainerConfigurator $containerConfigurator): void {
    // Skip the integrations folder
    $parameters = $containerConfigurator->parameters();
    $parameters->set(Option::SKIP, [
        __DIR__ . '/src/integrations',
    ]);

    // Import the Craft 4 upgrade rule set
    $containerConfigurator->import(CraftSetList::CRAFT_CMS_40);
};
```
